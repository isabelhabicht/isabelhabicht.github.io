My research explores how gender and social inequality unfold across different spheres of life. I combine quantitative methods, experimental designs, and comparative approaches to understand how institutions shape individual outcomes in three main areas:

1. [**Work and Family Dynamics**](#work-and-family-dynamics)  
2. [**Discrimination in the Labor Market**](#discrimination-in-the-labor-market)  
3. [**Academic Career Tracks**](#academic-career-tracks)

<h2 id="work-and-family-dynamics">1. Work and Family Dynamics</h2>

How do policy structures and labor market institutions influence gendered family decisions? My current research bridges micro-level preferences, meso-level labor market organization, and macro-level welfare regimes to explore how work and family intersect.

### <b> Parental Leave Uptake and Justice Principles </b>
<p>
To study distributive justice perceptions, I conducted a factorial survey experiment with vignettes that vary partner characteristics (gender, income, occupation, job satisfaction). 
You can view my most recent study â€” including hypotheses, methods, and results â€” in the poster below, presented at the Population Association of America (PAA) conference.

<h2 id="discrimination-in-the-labor-market">2. Discrimination in the Labor Market</h2>

What role does parenthood play in shaping labor market outcomes â€” and does it intersect with gender to create additional barriers? In this meta-analysis, we synthesize existing evidence on hiring discrimination against parents to understand how family roles influence professional opportunities.

### <b> Gender, Parenthood, and Hiring Discrimination: A Meta-Analysis </b>

While field experiments have extensively documented discrimination in hiring â€” especially by gender and ethnicity â€” the role of parenthood, particularly when intersecting with gender, has received less attention. This project addresses that gap by synthesizing evidence from 20 correspondence audit studies (n = 208 experimental conditions) on hiring discrimination against parents.

The study investigates:
- Whether parents face disadvantages compared to childless applicants,
- Whether discrimination is more prevalent among mothers, and
- How discrimination varies by national family policies, occupational characteristics, and time.

**Preliminary findings**:
Hiring discrimination against parents â€” particularly mothers â€” has declined over time and is no longer statistically significant in the most recent studies.

<h2 id="academic-career-tracks">3. Academic Career Tracks</h2>

In a BMBF-funded project with Mark Lutter and Martin SchrÃ¶der, we created a comprehensive panel dataset of all social scientists and economists at German universities. The goal: understand gendered dynamics in academic careers, from early stages to tenure.

### <b>Who Becomes a Tenured Professor? </b>

We find no significant gender differences in tenure outcomes across most disciplines â€” contrary to federal statistics suggesting a leaky pipeline. The exception: in economics, women show slightly lower (but statistically insignificant) chances of tenure.

### <b> Who Leaves Academia? </b>

In sociology, women are more likely to leave academia than men â€” even when controlling for productivity and CV characteristics.  
- Women often exit during the pre-doc stage, while men leave more frequently during the post-doc stage.
- Parenthood plays a role: mothers are more likely to leave than fathers, though this doesnâ€™t fully explain the gender gap in attrition.

### <b> Early Career Barriers </b>

In psychology, women face disadvantages in obtaining a habilitation â€” a key qualification for professorships â€” independent of parental status or CV strength.
