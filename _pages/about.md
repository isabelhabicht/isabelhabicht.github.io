I am a <i>social scientist</i> with a passion for <i>quantitative data and methods</i>. My research interests are in labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family trade-offs. <br> <br>
Currently, I am working as <i>Akademische Rätin für quantitative Methoden</i> at the <a href="https://www.org-soz.uni-wuppertal.de/de/team/detail/habicht/">University of Wuppertal</a>. If you are interested in my ongoing research projects, you can have a glimpse <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/research/">here</a>. Published work can be found <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/publications/">here</a>. <br> <br>
