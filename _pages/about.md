I am a <i>social scientist</i> with a passion for quantitative data and methods. My research interests include labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family dynamics. <br> <br>
As a <i>Akademische Rätin für quantitative Methoden</i>, I work at the <a href="https://www.org-soz.uni-wuppertal.de/de/team/detail/habicht/">University of Wuppertal</a>. If you are interested in my ongoing research projects, you can have a glimpse <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/research/">here</a>. Published work can be found <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/publications/">here</a>. <br> <br>
Currently, I am on leave from the University of Wuppertal until June 2025, as I am honored to be a JFK Memorial Fellow at the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/isabel-habicht">Center for European Studies (CES)</a> at Harvard University. At CES, I am examining the research question: <i>"How do policy regimes foster (wo)men's work-family preferences as reflected in parental leave decisions?"</i>. 

Feel free to <a href="mailto:habicht@uni-wuppertal.de">contact me</a> if you have any questions, comments, or ideas you want to share with me. <br> <br>
