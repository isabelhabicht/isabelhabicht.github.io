As a *social scientist* driven by a fascination for data and quantitative methods, I examine how societal structures shape opportunities and restrictions in work, academia, and family life. My research interests include labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family dynamics.
<br><br>
My work has appeared in leading journals such as <i>PLOS ONE</i>, <i>Research Policy</i>, <i>Higher Education</i>, <i>Scientometrics</i>, <i>Studies in Higher Education</i>, and <i>Frontiers in Sociology</i>, among others. 
You can explore some of my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/research/">ongoing work here</a>, and browse my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/publications/">published articles here</a>. 
<br><br>
I work at the <a href="https://www.org-soz.uni-wuppertal.de/de/team/detail/habicht/">University of Wuppertal</a> as *Akademische Rätin* for quantitative methods. In 2024/2025, I was on academic leave as <strong>JFK Memorial Fellow</strong> at the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/isabel-habicht">Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies (CES)</a> at Harvard University. At CES, I examined the research question: <i>"How do policy regimes foster (wo)men's work-family preferences as reflected in parental leave decisions?"</i>

<strong>NEWS:</strong> I am currently (February–March 2026) a <strong>Visiting Fellow</strong> at the 
<strong>Institute for Analytical Sociology (IAS)</strong> at <strong>Linköping University</strong>, 
where I further develop my research on women and mothers in the labor market:  
<i>Do employers practice what they preach? Parenthood bias in hiring, self-presentation, and self-perception in Germany.</i>
