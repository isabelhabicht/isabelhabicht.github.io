As a *social scientist* driven by a fascination for data and quantitative methods, I explore how societal structures shape opportunities in work, academia, and family life. My research interests include labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family dynamics.
<br><br>
My work has appeared in leading journals such as <i>PLOS ONE</i>, <i>Research Policy</i>, <i>Higher Education</i>, <i>Scientometrics</i>, <i>Studies in Higher Education</i>, and <i>Frontiers in Sociology</i>, among others. 
You can explore some of my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/research/">ongoing work here</a>, and browse my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/publications/">published articles here</a>. 
<br><br>
I work at the <a href="https://www.org-soz.uni-wuppertal.de/de/team/detail/habicht/">University of Wuppertal</a> as *Akademische RÃ¤tin fÃ¼r quantitative Methoden*. But I am currently on academic leave until June 2025 as the <strong>JFK Memorial Fellow</strong> at the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/isabel-habicht">Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies (CES)</a> at Harvard University. At CES, I examine the research question: <i>"How do policy regimes foster (wo)men's work-family preferences as reflected in parental leave decisions?"</i>
<br><br>
Feel free to <a href="mailto:habicht@uni-wuppertal.de">contact me</a> if you have any questions, comments, or ideas you'd like to share.  
Looking forward to connecting with fellow researchers, collaborators, and curious minds.
