As a *social scientist* driven by a fascination for data and quantitative methods, I explore how societal structures shape opportunities in work, academia, and family life. My research interests include labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family dynamics.  
<br>
I work at the <a href="https://www.org-soz.uni-wuppertal.de/de/team/detail/habicht/">University of Wuppertal</a> as *Akademische RÃ¤tin fÃ¼r quantitative Methoden* (Lecturer in Quantitative Methods).  
You can explore some of my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/research/">ongoing work here</a>, and browse a selection of my <a href="https://isabelhabicht.github.io/publications/">published articles here</a>.  
<br>
I am currently on academic leave until June 2025 as the <strong>JFK Memorial Fellow</strong> at the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/isabel-habicht">Center for European Studies (CES)</a> at Harvard University.  
At CES, I examine the research question:  
<i>"How do policy regimes foster (wo)men's work-family preferences as reflected in parental leave decisions?"</i>  
This project investigates how national policy structures influence gendered preferences and decision-making â€” with broader implications for understanding persistent inequalities in modern societies.  
<br>
Feel free to <a href="mailto:habicht@uni-wuppertal.de">contact me</a> if you have any questions, comments, or ideas you'd like to share.  
Looking forward to connecting with fellow researchers, collaborators, and curious minds.
