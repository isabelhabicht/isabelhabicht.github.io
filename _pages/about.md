I am a social scientist with a passion for quantitative data and methods. My research interests are in labor market sociology, gender inequality, higher education research, academic careers, and work-family trade-offs. <br> <br>
Currently, I am working as <i>Akademische Rätin für quantitative Methoden</i> at the University of Wuppertal. If you are interested in my ongoing research projects, you can have a glimpse here. Published work can be found here. <br> <br>
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or ideas you want to share with me. <br> <br>
