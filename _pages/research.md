My research explores how gender and social inequality unfold across different spheres of life. I combine quantitative methods, experimental designs, and comparative approaches to understand how institutions shape individual outcomes in three main areas:

1. [**Work and Family Dynamics**](#work-and-family-dynamics)  
2. [**Discrimination in the Labor Market**](#discrimination-in-the-labor-market)  
3. [**Academic Career Tracks**](#academic-career-tracks)

<h2 id="work-and-family-dynamics">1. Work and Family Dynamics</h2>

How do policy structures and labor market institutions influence gendered family decisions? My current research bridges micro-level preferences, meso-level labor market organization, and macro-level welfare regimes to explore how work and family intersect.

### Parental Leave Uptake and Justice Principles

My current project investigates how parental leave is fairly allocated between couples in Germany. In 2022, mothers took an average of 11.6 months of parental leave, compared to just 2.8 months for fathers — a gender gap of 76 percentage points.

To study distributive justice perceptions, I conducted a factorial survey experiment (preregistered on <a href="https://osf.io/87qup" target="_blank">OSF</a>) with vignettes that vary partner characteristics (gender, income, occupation, job satisfaction). The study was fielded in November 2023.

**Preliminary findings**:
- Respondents supported a nearly equal division: 6.6 months for mothers vs. 5.9 months for fathers.
- However, the perceived just allocation tolerated an 11 percentage point gap, favoring fathers — suggesting a justice threshold before inequality is seen as unjust.

<h2 id="discrimination-in-the-labor-market">2. Discrimination in the Labor Market</h2>

What role does parenthood play in shaping labor market outcomes — and does it intersect with gender to create additional barriers? In this meta-analysis, we synthesize existing evidence on hiring discrimination against parents to understand how family roles influence professional opportunities.

### Gender, Parenthood, and Hiring Discrimination: A Meta-Analysis

While field experiments have extensively documented discrimination in hiring — especially by gender and ethnicity — the role of parenthood, particularly when intersecting with gender, has received less attention. This project addresses that gap by synthesizing evidence from 20 correspondence audit studies (n = 208 experimental conditions) on hiring discrimination against parents.

The study investigates:
- Whether parents face disadvantages compared to childless applicants,
- Whether discrimination is more prevalent among mothers, and
- How discrimination varies by national family policies, occupational characteristics, and time.

**Preliminary findings**:
- Hiring discrimination against parents — particularly mothers — has declined over time and is no longer statistically significant in the most recent studies.

<h2 id="academic-career-tracks">3. Academic Career Tracks</h2>

In a BMBF-funded project with Mark Lutter and Martin Schröder, we created a comprehensive panel dataset of all social scientists and economists at German universities. The goal: understand gendered dynamics in academic careers, from early stages to tenure.

### Who Becomes a Tenured Professor?

We find no significant gender differences in tenure outcomes across most disciplines — contrary to federal statistics suggesting a leaky pipeline. The exception: in economics, women show slightly lower (but statistically insignificant) chances of tenure.

### Who Leaves Academia?

In sociology, women are more likely to leave academia than men — even when controlling for productivity and CV characteristics.  
- Women often exit during the pre-doc stage, while men leave more frequently during the post-doc stage.
- Parenthood plays a role: mothers are more likely to leave than fathers, though this doesn’t fully explain the gender gap in attrition.

### Early Career Barriers

In psychology, women face disadvantages in obtaining a habilitation — a key qualification for professorships — independent of parental status or CV strength.  

---

**Conclusion**:  
Gender disparities in academic careers manifest at different stages and in discipline-specific ways. Our research shows that gender inequality must be studied as a cumulative process, not just an endpoint.
